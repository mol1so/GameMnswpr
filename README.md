# GameMnswpr
GameMnswpr is a school project programmed entirely in C. It is a console application.

- The game consists of one minefield, where the aim of the game is to reveal all the fields containing mines without actually revealing them. 

- For debugging purposes, you can easily open the 'GameMnswpr' directory, which contains all the game source files, as a CMAKE project in Visual Studio.

- If you just want to play the game, just download and run the .exe in the 'ProgramRelease' directory.
